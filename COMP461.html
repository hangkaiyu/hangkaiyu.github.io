              	<h3>Course Description</h3>
              	Robots are now a wide spectrum of various embodiments, e.g., humanoids, dogs, industrial arms, drones, and self-driving cars, and they are rapidly merging themselves into our society. While we are not fully ready to welcome them, yet, we are more than certain that we need to work with them in ways that we did not know before. On the one hand, we are still challenged by many technical problems to enable robots to be more dexterous and robust. On another hand, in a time where resources are connected and networked, we need to design novel systems to manage different robots, share the robots, or even make them autonomously and adaptively build teams. <br><br>

								In this senior design course, we will develop team-based projects and will look into a robotized future with our imaginations: we will either solve problems that are technically going to enhance the robot skills, or address problems that will make future robots more useful and more organized in the real world. Background in robotics is not required. In our creative projects, your efforts in developing core robot algorithms, databases, machine learning systems, web applications, mobile apps, LLM models, or anything else that can be useful, will together make this robotized world a better place.<br>

            <hr>
              	<h3>Grading</h3>
              	The grading of this senior design course is point-based. Students will collect points, as evaluated by their performance, along the course by completing all required course components listed below:<br><br>

              	<b>*Essay (10 points)</b>: At the beginning of the course, reading materials will be provided. An essay by each student is required after the reading to help students discuss and understand why we are in a robotized world, and what we can do to make it a better world.<br><br>
              	<b>*Project proposal presentation (5 points)</b>: In the 3rd week, each team needs to deliver a presentation on their research proposal. <u>This is done before the written proposal is due. An approval after this presentation is required before each team proceeds to writing the proposal.</u> <br><br>
              	<b>*Project proposal (10 points)</b>: By the end of the 4th week (5pm on Friday) of the course, each team is required to submit a project proposal.<br><br>
              	<b>*Weekly reports (10 points)</b>: After the project proposal is approved and the project begins, every team is required to submit a report by <u>5pm every Friday</u> to summarize the progress, problems encountered, and the plan for next week. <br><br>
              	<b>*Mid-term presentation (5 points)</b>: A mid-term presentation is required for each team to show their progress and any potential adjustments to the project plan. <br><br>
              	<b>*Project deliverables (50 points)</b>: The project deliverables, e.g., a software and code documentation, should be demonstrated and submitted by each team by the end of the course. The evaluation of the deliverables will be based on novelty (10 points), societal impact (10 points), implementation quality (10 points), scalability (10 points), and user experiences (10 points).<br><br>
              	<b>*Project final report (10 points)</b>: By the end of the course, every team needs to submit a comprehensive final report.<br><br>
              	<b>*Project final presentation (10 points)</b>: By the end of the course, every team needs to deliver a presentation to show their design.<br><br>

              	<b>Late submission</b>: For each submission, 1 point will be deducted every day after the due date.

              	2. What are the pros and cons of robotizing this world?<br>
              	3. How are robots different from machines?<br>
              	4. What is the relationship between robotics and AI?<br>
              	5. For robots to work in this world, what infrastructure do we need to build to support them?<br>
              	6. If you have sufficient skills and resources, what robot applications would you like to create?<br>
